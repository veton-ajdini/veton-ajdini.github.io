                Hello! This is my website where I will, hopefully, showcase my Web Developing skills. <br>
                
                <br>I am a Management & Technology student at TUM - with a specialization in Computer Engineering. I learned a lot in this university. From business and management, to pure engineering and programming. <br>

                <br>I also work as a Java Developer (Working student) at a little company called ZEISS. I've mostly worked on the front-end side of the software application project called CallistoEye. Cool stuff. <br>
